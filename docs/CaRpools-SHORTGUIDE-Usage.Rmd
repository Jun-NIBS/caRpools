# Files and Folder Structure to use CaRpools

__Please note: the MAIN FOLDER must be the R working directory!__  
Data and Script paths can be adjusted in the MIACCS file.

The following files are neccessary to use CaRpools for report generation:  

**MIACCS.xls**  
Minimum Information About CRISPR/Cas Screens.  This file needs to be filled out to provide all necessary informations about the screen.  

**R Markdown Template files**  
Either CaRpools-extended-PDF.rmd, CaRpools-PDF.rmd or CaRpools-extended-HTML.rmd or CaRpools-HTML.rmd. Is the template for report generation.  

**Data Files**  
Two replicates per Control and Treated. Can be FASTQ files OR already mapped, not normalized read count files.  

**CRISPR-mapping.pl**  
PERL script to map your extracted FASTQ files, if desired (as indicated in the MIACCS.xls)  

**CRISPR-extract.pl**  
PERL script to extract 20 nt target sequence from FAST files, if desired (as indicated in the MIACCS.xls)  

**CaRpools.png**  
The logo file  

The following files are necessary to use _single_ CaRpools functions:  


**Data Files**  
Either raw read count files or FASTQ files (that need to be extracted and mapped using CaRpools)  

Please note that CaRpools always starts with loading data files. For raw-readcount files, use `load.file`. For FASTQ files, please see the sections below.

## Start CaRpools VirtualBox Image

**Please see **CaRpools-SHORTGUIDE-VirtualBox.pdf/html** or the shortguid [here](https://github.com/boutroslab/caRpools/blob/master/docs/CaRpools-SHORTGUIDE-VirtualBox.Rmd) for how to use it.

## Setup Files and R-Studio on your own computer

All packages and software tools need be installed correctly as shown before.  

1. Copy all files in the designated folders as shown above.
  * __Please note: the MAIN FOLDER must be R working directory!__
  * The MIACCS.xls as well the R markdown template and CaRpools.png must be in the same folder as the R working dir.
2. Adjust the path to the data and scripts folder if necessary in the MIACCS.xls . Use the absolute path. If the folder structure is as shown above, you do not need to make any adjustments.
3. Adjust and fill out the **MIACCS.xls** file.
4. You can use `CarPools(type="check")` to check for the correct folder structure and data file presence as it is indicated in the MIACCS.xls file.
5. You can check for your R working directory by `getwd()` and set it to any directory you want by `setwd("/PATH")`.

## Important information for MAC users

If you use Rstudio on MAC, please make sure you start Rstudio with the following command from the terminal:

> open -a rstudio

## Check Setup

You can verify that the MIACCS.xls file as well as the used template file and all necessary scripts are found by calling `check.caRpools()`.  
See below for more information about the arguments.  
By default, it **requires a correct MIACCS file + the script files + all packages installed + MAGeCK + Bowtie2 + Pandoc.**

# Start CaRpools Report Generation

You can start caRpools Report Generation after you did the following steps:

* Installed all required software and R packages (use _check.caRpools(files=FALSE)_ to verify)
* Put every file in the correct folder (MIACCS, data files, script files, Rmd templates)
* Put everythin in the R working directory or set the working directory to the folder of your files
* Filled out the MIACCS file with all information, e.g. correct filenames, reference, data analysis options

You can check for all requirements by calling `check.caRpools`.

## Start CaRpools using R-Studio

In the case you use R-Studio, you can start caRpools by just opening the corresponding Rmd template file.  
At the top, you will find the **Knit PDF** or **Knit HTML** button, so you just need to press that and caRpools will generate the report.

As an alternative, you can start caRpools via `use.caRpools` and provide additional parameters (see below).  

## Start CaRpools using R console

Moreover, caRpools report generation can also be initiated without R-studio installation, so that this can be done via R command line even on remote computers.  
In this case, caRpools report generation can be started via `use.caRpools` with additional parameters, which are described below.  

#### use.caRpools()

**Usage:**  
*use.caRpools(type=NULL, file="CaRpools-extended-PDF.Rmd", miaccs="MIACCS.xls", check=TRUE, work.dir=NULL)*  

**type**  
*Description* If you provide a custom Rmd template that can generate both, PDF and HTML reports you can indicate which version you want to generate.  
*Default* NULL  
*Values* "PDF", "HTML"  

**file**  
*Description* The file name of your custom Rmd template file (with extension).  
*Default* "CaRpools-extended-PDF.Rmd"  
*Values* filename as character  

**miaccs**  
*Description* The filename of your MIACCS file.  
*Default* "MIACCS.xls"  
*Values* filename as character 

**check**  
*Description* Indicates whether caRpools will check for correct installation and file access.  
*Default* TRUE  
*Values* TRUE or FALSE (boolean)  

**work.dir**  
*Description* You can provide the absolute path to the working directory in which all files are placed (e.g. the MIACCS.xls and Rmd template).  
*Default* NULL 
*Values* absolute path (character) or NULL if standard R working directory is used
