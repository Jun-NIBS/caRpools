caRpools - a software package for the analysis CRISPR/Cas9 pooled screens
==============

CaRpools is an R package forexploratory data analysis of pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screens. It aims to provide a user-friendly pipeline for end-to-end analysis of screening data. As an output, it generates standardized PDF and HTML reports that include:

* In-depth analysis of screening quality
* Candidate hit calling using multiple, independent algorithms
* In-depth analysis of sgRNA phenotypes
* XLS output for  storage and follow-up analysis
* Annotation of candidate genes using biomaRt

Users fill out a configuration file and caRpools runs a complete analysis workflow, including NGS data extraction and mapping.
