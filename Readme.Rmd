Welcome to CaRpools - The CRISPR-AnalyzeR for pooled screens
==============

CaRpools is a R package used to analyze pooled CRISPR/Cas screens in a **standardized**, **easy** and **reproducible** way.  
It can be used to generate standardized PDF and HTML reports that include:

* In-depth Analysis of Screening Quality
* Candidate Calling (Hit Calling) using different methods in a combined way
* In-depth Analysis of sgRNA effects
* XLS output for convenient storage and follow-up usage
* Automatic annotation of your candidate genes, no need to manually look them up!

CaRpools serves as an end-to-end analysis platform so that the user just needs to fill out MIACCS user file (Minimum Information About CRISPR/Cas Screens) and let CaRpools do the job, including NGS data extraction and mapping, if desired.

You want to give it a try?
