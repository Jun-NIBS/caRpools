Welcome to CaRpools - a software package for the analysis CRISPR/Cas9 pooled screens
==============

CaRpools is a R package to be used to analyze pooled CRISPR/Cas screens in a **standardized** and **user-friendly** manner.  
It generates standardized PDF and HTML reports that include:

* In-depth analysis of screening quality
* Candidate hit calling using multiple, independent algorithms
* In-depth analysis of sgRNA phenotypes
* XLS output for  storage and follow-up analysis
* Annotation of candidate genes using biomaRt

CaRpools serves as an end-to-end analysis platform. Users simply fill out a configuration file and caRpools run a complete analysis workflow, including NGS data extraction and mapping, if necessary.
