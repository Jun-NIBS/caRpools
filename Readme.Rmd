caRpools - a software package for the analysis CRISPR/Cas9 pooled screens
==============
![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/caRpools)

__Attention:__ Due to the downtime of the community-server of biomaRt, caRpools 0.82.5 does not function properly.
Use 0.83 that uses by default the Ensembl servers for data annotation.


CaRpools is an R package forexploratory data analysis of pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screens. It aims to provide a user-friendly pipeline for end-to-end analysis of screening data. As an output, it generates standardized PDF and HTML reports that include:

* In-depth analysis of screening quality
* Candidate hit calling using multiple, independent algorithms
* In-depth analysis of sgRNA phenotypes
* XLS output for  storage and follow-up analysis
* Annotation of candidate genes using biomaRt

Users fill out a configuration file and caRpools runs a complete analysis workflow, including NGS data extraction and mapping.

### Download the VirtualBox appliance of caRpools
The VirtualBox appliance can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/boutroslab/caRpools/blob/master/docs/CaRpools-SHORTGUIDE-VirtualBox.Rmd)

It provides you a ready-to-use virtual appliance, so that you do not need to install any additional R packages or tools.

### Download R package
You can download the R package either
* within **R** via `install.packages("caRpools")`
* or as a **.tgz** file directly from [HERE](https://github.com/boutroslab/caRpools/blob/master/package)

### Tip for Mac Users
If you can't get RStudio to call system commands, you need to start Rstudio from command line.  
In order to allow RStudio to start system commands, please start RStudio via the terminal by typing:

__open -a rstudio__
